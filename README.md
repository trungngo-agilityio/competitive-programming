## What is competitive program

In short, it is a "mind sport". 

## Why I am doing this?

Because I have done competitive programming before and I think that helped me in many ways. I made this study to see if I can help coaching my kids or anyone else down the line.

## Why C++?

Because many competitive programmers and I think that is the language that could help to win.
